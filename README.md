###### Essential Global Packages

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  -- NodeJs's installation includes Chocolatey, a windows package manager, so commands that begin with `chocho` should be executable from any admin console.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager, if not already on your system. This is an alternative to Npm. Yarn is maintained by Facebook and known to be faster. It will replace your `npm` console commands.
  - `choco install yarn`

###### Browser Tools
